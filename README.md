# DELIVERME-Socially-Relevant-Project
It's all about controlling people's gatherings at shops and markets by assigning a  person who lives at the same area, helping them buy things they need from a shop that they are visiting too(rewarded) thereby helping each other at this COVID situation and also controlling traffic.
